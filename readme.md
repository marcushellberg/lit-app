# LitElement tutorial

This is a tutorial app showing you how to build a Progressive Web App using:

- LitElement
- lit-html
- Redux
- Vaadin Router

You can also use this as a starter for your own app.

## Running

Install all dependencies with `npm install`, then either run the development server with

```
npm run dev
```

or create a production build with

```
npm run prod
```

## PWA

By default, the app uses an empty service worker during development time. You can enable ServiceWorker in development by running the app with `npm run dev:sw`. The production build has ServiceWorker enabled by default.
